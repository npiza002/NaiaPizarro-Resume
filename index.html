        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is naia pizarro. I am currently a freshman at the University of California, Riverside. I am currently studying Public Policy, and am planning on pursuing the international policy and social policy tracks. Post graduation, I have aspirations of pursuing law! I am currently interested in immigration law, but am open to expanding my interests and experiences to better find a fit in the legal field ! 

Currently my experiences in the public policy field consist of multiple internships, shadwoships, and leadership opportunities that I have been able to participate in. In the past year, i have been able to learn from influential role models in the education, public health, and governance fields. From these experiences, i have been able to apply my efforts towards improving my local community. Interning for Congressman Gil Cisneros I was ble to reach out to local constituents and voice their concerns to demand policy change in the 39th congressional district. As a representative for my high school, school district, I was able to voice the concerns of my school district and student body through quarterly meetings with fellow representatives of the Los Angeles County.
